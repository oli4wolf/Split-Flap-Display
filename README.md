# Flap-Display
This Project is subdivided into different parts

* Initial Codebase of FAI for Toni Prototype
* The plan for a productline
* Project separating into Mechanical Topic, Electronical and Powersupply and the different variants.
** Mechanical Work
** Electronics and Powersupply
** Prototype Toni
** Simplistic Clock
** Complex Modul

# Initial Codebase can be found in this Folder. 
This folder contains the whole documentation with Protocol and manual that could be found and gathered. It's just a collection for historical purpose.
This was the beginning of the project. First it was just a clock from passionate Swiss Federal Railway person for home use. While the split-flap displays
where removed and replaced through digital displays with more flexible options. They created a clock that could be replicated, with the documentation in
French.
This initial work was used to create a gift for the new Boss of the Swiss Federal Railway responsible for person transportation (his name: Toni).
The gift had more capabilities (13x Alphabetic letters). The letter didn't work when the Gift was given.

# The plan for aproductline
A second wave of replacement was delayed and planned for 2019. At the same time an addition for the letters of Toni's variant was planned.
The idea is and was that the electro.-mechanical apprentice with the software apprentice create a second life for the Split-Flap displays.
These were removed and stored. Can be revamped by the electromechanical apprentice and put into a new frame with new electronics and
the more complex modules could be programmed by the software apprentice.
An initial Software can be found in this project. Additional functionality like Network connection or other are in the hand of the apprentices.
## Mechanical Work
(Todo: Topic of Rework anyway solution of split-flaps)
Tonis Gift was a wooden box, which can't be created for a bigger product. We can't create that much wooden box. So the idea is to have a metallic one.
(Todo: The box)
## Electronics and Powersupply
Im not that good in electronics. Therefore i based the rework on the prototype of Toni.
Powersupply stays the same. 
With all clocks we add two buttons (minutes +1, Hour +1).
Complex modules have an additional button (activate messages).

Different buttons have different issues. I added a capacitor to smooven the signal (which helps agains spurious signals).

### Prototype Toni
See initial Codebase

### Simplistic Clock

### Complex modules
See simplistic clock. Addtional i have added a buzzer and an additional button.

## Codebase
### Prototype Toni
See Initial Codebase
### Adding Letters

### Rework the code for simplistic clock

### Rework the code for MKR (Toni Variant)

# Known-Issues
* Somehow i have to have the end/begin of each signal send to a split-flap
* There is no feedback signal if the messages are on or off
